PROJECT TITLE: Easton Farmers' Market Simulation
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To attempt to find an optimal structure of market stalls and lines to speed up customer movement
                     through the market.
VERSION or DATE: v1.0 17 October 2015
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: To run a single instance of the simulation create and instance of market and execute the
                            'runSim' method. To test multiple variations in which the numnber of stalls and the number
                            of line per stall change, create an instance of the controller class and execute the runAll
                            method.

USER INSTRUCTIONS: If you would like to change the MEAN and STDV values used to generate the various times and needs of
                   customers, you can find them at the top of the Market class and the Customer Class.
                   
NOTE: Unit testing is a bit sparse. I simply ran out of time. I will however be adding the rest in no matter what, I would
      love to get some feed back on it even though it cannot be calculated into my grade.
